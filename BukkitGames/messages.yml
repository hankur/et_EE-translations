# This is your messages.yml file. In here you can customize all BukkitGames messages.
# Use double quotes (") instead of single quotes (') for strings! $0, $1 etc. are placeholders for variables.
# It's adviced to translate the messages and not change their meaning, because some messages might be used in different situations.

# If you want to change the kick message when your server restarts, go to your 'bukkit.yml' file and change the option 'shutdown-message'.

# It would be nice if you would share your finished translation.
